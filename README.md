# CMU Cloud Lab Documentation

## Welcome!
This website hosts documentation about the CMU Cloud Lab. All content is created and maintained by students at CMU, with
the goal of creating a shared body of knowledge to make this next-generation facility as accessible as possible to users
of all skill levels. We rely on *you* to make this documentation useful. If you believe there's something missing from
these pages, find any mistakes, or have an idea of how to make this website better, we'd love to hear from you!
